This is a mod to ring an alarm if someone does something suspicious. You can place this in your localmods folder in your barotrauma install folder to use it.

This mod should run locally only, meaning even if run on a server it will not be required to download for players. The server will appear vanilla.

Each item has a suspicion level, and that level gets added to each players total score when they pick it up or use the item. Once the score goes over a threshold alarms start going off for the host.
The suspicion level for players naturally falls over time. As long as players dont do too much suspicious stuff too fast they should be fine.
Its basically a warning that the host needs to check the logs because he might be getting griefed. 

It also has detectors for someone putting the reactor into a bad state, or rewiring things, or undocking a drone. These require this mod to be running on the server. Everything else will run even in someone elses game.
